11/7: Okay, plan of attack.
First, figure out how to identify var names for tables, such as Sales S.
Second, figure out how to compare values between two tables.
Finally figure out how a outer join and an innerjoin are different from basic select.

DipslayTable(Type of join, the selected indexs, column, filters)
Determine the filters
Determine which type of join it is.
If comma, 
    If where exists, filter
    Otherwise, don't filter
Else if some kind of join
    Must have join
        if inner join, filter
        else if outer join, don't filter first list then filter second one

Select nearly finished. Just need to adjust actual display to work with all these items. Then, for both types, make function that
will find the smaller list of the comparison, then expand smaller list with matching duplicates. Then the project should be done.
