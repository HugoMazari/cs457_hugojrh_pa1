Every other project is going to rely on this one, so I need to make my own SQL database.
How to do so is the question?
Each database can be a folder with [USERNAME].hdb
Each table can be a folder with {USERNAME}.htb
Each item can be a file named [USERNAME].hab
Each table can have a file named template.hab to hold the attributes of each table.
That's easy.
The fun part comes with the editing each item. If the table includes another table as an attribute
maybe I should mark with ###(USERNAME.htb)### and list the attributes of the table just so it's convient to search.
And then data manipulation. I assume I would use some classes to mess with that, but what classes exactly. One for a table
and another for a database. They would have to be link list for the attributes.
